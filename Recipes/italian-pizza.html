    <h2>Instruction </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the Dough:
            <ol>
                <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and dry yeast. Stir and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>Mix the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center, pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil, and mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
                <li>Knead: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky but not too wet.</li>
                <li>Let it rise: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare the Sauce :
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the canned tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or a spoon. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of oregano if desired.</li>
                <li>Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the Oven:
            <ol><li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (usually 250°C/475°F) for at least 30 minutes. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li></ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the Dough 
            <ol>
                <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into 2-4 equal portions, depending on how big you want your pizzas.</li>
                <li>Roll out each portion into a thin circle or stretch it by hand, leaving a slightly thicker edge for the crust.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the Pizza:
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough.</li>
                <li>Tear the mozzarella cheese into pieces and scatter them over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the Pizza:
            <ol>
                <li>Slide the pizza onto a preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven, drizzle with more olive oil if desired, and add a few more fresh basil leaves.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve
            <ol><li>Slice the pizza and enjoy immediately!</li></ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For an authentic Italian pizza, less is more when it comes to toppings. Stick with a few high-quality ingredients.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for longer (overnight in the fridge) for a more flavorful crust.</li>
    </ul>
